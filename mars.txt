I have my toolbelt and ready to blast off to Mars
Docked to spacestation and ready for the final sling
On the way to mars
Closing to mars for landing
I prefer traveling to the moon.
I'd like to add a new feature for a stop at the Moon on the way to Mars.
I would also join you after mars trip
I am conflict-averse. Maybe I'll join you on Mars.
This is from RStudio
